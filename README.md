# The Escapist

Collect tools, look for clues, and solve riddles in order to Escape your ultimate demise. (advanced deliverable: timed game)

- C: create new player/user
- R: show inventory, hints in the room, and tools they can pick up
- U: update the foreign key of the tool item so that it matches the owner
- D: delete an item from our inventory by it's name 


# Object Relationships:

- one-to-one: Tools can only belong to one player
- one-to-many: A player can have multiple tools

# Constraints:

- player names: of type str and less than 15 characters
- tools: tools have to be of type Tool (instance)
